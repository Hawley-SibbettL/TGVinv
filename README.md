# TGVinv
Total generalized variation inversion for ERT inversion, using a modified version of IP4DI code. 


This software allows the 2.5D inversion of ERT data using TGV, l2 and TV (l1) regularisation methods.
It is based on the versatile ERT and IP inversion software IP4DI, for single lines of surface electrodes. 
TGV inversion favours piecewise affine (blocky regions separated by linear gradients) behaviour, allowing 
both smooth and sharp contrasts to be captured by the inversion.
